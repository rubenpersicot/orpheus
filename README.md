# Orpheus
[Orpheus](https://github.com/rubenpersicot/orpheus) is an academic project, it is part of the "Sofware development and design" course taught at the [Ecole des Ponts Paristech](https://www.ecoledesponts.fr/en) by Xavier Leclerc.

Orpheus is a website dedicated to musicians. Starting from an audio file composed of different sources, the website is able to split the initial recording in several files, each one of them containing a different source. For exemple, if the input is a recording of a singer playing the guitar, Orpheus outputs two audio files. The first one only contains the voice of the singer whereas the second one only contains the sound of the guitar. 

This site is named after [Orpheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orpheus),a legendary musician and poet in ancient Greek religion.
